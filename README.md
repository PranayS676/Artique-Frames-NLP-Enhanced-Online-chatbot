Artique-Frames: NLP-Enhanced Online Art Delivery chatbot
#### Artique-Frames Project Summary:

Artique-Frames is an  chatbot designed to  order art painting using leveraging NLP. Utilizing Dialogflow, it interprets user queries with natural language processing, making art selection intuitive and user-friendly. The backend infrastructure is built on FastAPI and MySQL, ensuring robust data management and seamless API interactions for functionalities like order processing and status tracking.

#### Key Components:

##### MySQL Database: 
Hosts comprehensive data on paintings, orders, and tracking, providing a solid foundation for the system's data storage and retrieval needs.(The dataset utilized in this project was synthetically generated and is entirely fictional, designed specifically for the purposes of this application. It should be noted that all data points, entities, and scenarios were crafted by the project author to simulate real-world application scenarios without utilizing actual personal or proprietary information.)
##### FastAPI Backend: 
Powers the system's API endpoints, facilitating essential operations such as item insertion, order ID generation, and price calculations.
#####vDialogflow Integration: 
Enables the chatbot to process natural language inputs, allowing for dynamic conversations about art selections and orders.
##### Deployment and Integration:
Deployed locally with Uvicorn as the ASGI server and Ngrok for internet exposure, Artique-Frames showcases a practical blend of NLP, web development, and database management. This project not only demonstrates the effective application of NLP in e-commerce but also highlights the integration of various technologies to deliver a user-centric online service
